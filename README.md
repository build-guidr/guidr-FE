# ABOUT GUIDR

GuidR is meant to help back country guides log both their private and professional tips into a portfolio to showcase to friends and clients. GuidR users can login, create and update their trips, and categorize them as private or professional. Users can also publish a one-page portfolio about themselves, such as the types of guide adventures they specialize in and length of experience.
